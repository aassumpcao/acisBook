# Preamble {-}

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The R **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")

# or the development version
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```
