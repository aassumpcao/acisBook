We have created this book using the R programming language, which allows us to integrate CJIL analysis, code, graphics, and software for external consumption -- all products of empirical research available to our partners.

Please check our social media feed on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjil) and code base on [GitHub](https://github.com/aassumpcao).
